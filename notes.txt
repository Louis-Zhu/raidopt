Code to generate the experiment list is in AllPairs-*/examples/raid.py. To run it execute PYTHONPATH=.. python raid.py

TODO:
change password of ubuntu templates to 'password'
disable X on all templates
create benchmark wrapper and place on all Vms (/home/dan/benchmark.sh):
/home/dan/phoronix-test-suite/phoronix-test-suite benchmark pts/disk <<EOS

- run_experiment_on_template():
		clone vm template to vm to run experiment
		start vm
		wait for vm tools to start on boot
		execute experiment
		wait for experiment to complete
		save results of experiment
		delete vm

- run_experiment(experiment):
	 	do cleanup if necessary?
		create RAID array w/experiment params
		configure vc/esx:
			set drive to be ssd
			create datastore
		run_experiment_on_template()
		delete datastore


- Test all VM templates can run experiment w/out problems
	ensure that array is in RAID0
	for each template:
		run_experiment_on_template()

- Run all-pairs experiments:
    load list of all experiments
	 load list of already run experiments
	 difference to find experiments to run
	 for each experiment to run (randomly ordered):
	 	run_experiment(experiment)

- predict(experiments):
	format data in a form suitable for training models
	train RandomForest models on the data
	predict the performance of all permutations of the experiments
	sort the experiments by performance rank

- predict_optimal_experiment():
	// procedure to predict optimal settings of a set of experiments
	predictions = predict(experiments)
	return the best experiment based on predictions

- learning process:
	// first go for all-pairs coverage so the model has something to work with
	run_all_pairs_experiments()

	// next go for greedy
	while True:
		best = predict_optimal_experiment()
		if best has already been run:
			break
		run_experiment(best)
	
	// next go for a bit of random what's left. Stop if we haven't improved for a while
	num_runs_without_improvement = 0
	while num_runs_without_improvement < 10:
		predictions_of_unrun = predict(experiments not yet run)
		sort experiments_not_yet_run by predictions_of_unrun
		// use rgamma to weight toward the best expected result, or runif to weight uniformly for any of them
		experiment_to_run = experiments_not_yet_run[floor(min(rgamma(1, shape=1, scale=log(nrow(experiments_not_yet_run))), nrow(experiments_not_yet_run)))]
		run_experiment(experiment_to_run)
		if last_experiment is the new best:
			num_runs_without_improvement = 0
		else:
			num_runs_without_improvement += 1




DONE:
- Find a MegaCLI that works or use WBEM to control it.
  - Try installing Latest MegaRAID Firmware/VMware ESX5.5MN:    6.603.55.00.1vmw_MR_VMware5_Driver_esx55.tgz
    - See if MegaCLI works or if Storage Manager works - NO
    - See if StorCLI works: 1.09.13_StorCLI.zip
	 X Solution is to disable pre-existing driver (thanks to lsi support)
